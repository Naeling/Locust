# Locust
IC06 project's repository
I developed the code for this project alone and in a very few time because I have no choice.
The code is pretty bad and not very maintainable because I developed it very fast.
To get a better insight into the type of code I want to produce, please see my other repositories Locust-rework and rock-the-ball.
